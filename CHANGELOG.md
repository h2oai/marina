# Changelog

All notable changes to Marina are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Read-only native-evolution qualification, a dedicated MCP evolution tool, and a bounded soak gate
  with machine-readable connection, error, throughput, and p95 latency evidence.
- Expandable evolution lineage/evidence telemetry, self-contained three-role live trials, and
  reconnect/session-token churn qualification.
- Durable provenance-aware contradiction cases spanning agents and shared memory pools, with
  `left`, `right`, `both`, and `neither` resolution modes, reviewer rationale, verification history,
  terminal commands, and dashboard APIs.
- Outcome-based attention learning from approved, rejected, and expired task claims. Adjustments are
  bounded, durable, and idempotent; explicit operator feedback remains supported.
- Outcome-level productivity sessions measuring success, completion latency, tool-call effort,
  direct-message handoffs, seven-day throughput, daily trends, and per-agent leaderboards.
- `productivity` / `impact` commands, productivity and contradiction APIs, and operational dashboard
  summaries for outcome performance and open conflicts.
- A persistent dashboard alert indicator, graphical readiness and productivity views, filtered alert
  history, in-place contradiction resolution, selectable map layers, event heatmap access, and
  spatial warning/critical markers.
- Privacy-safe primitive-use evidence for humans and agents, including canonical command success and
  latency, agent tool provenance, outcome correlation, readiness checks, and dashboard leaderboards.

### Changed

- Agent runtime port configuration now preserves the runtime referenced by command handlers, and
  spawn rejects names that world login would otherwise truncate into a different identity.
- Reworked the model-agnostic pi-agent system contract around outcome framing, selective retrieval,
  deliberate tool use, result verification, durable provenance, explicit stopping/replanning, and
  equal treatment of humans and opportunistic agents. Dynamic world, memory, transcript, and tool
  content is now explicitly kept below governing instructions.
- Compaction now preserves objective, success criteria, evidence, decisions, commitments, plan state,
  failures, contradictions, and next action. Silent-turn and stuck recovery no longer manufacture
  `think`, observation, movement, or notes merely to produce activity.
- Memory quality alerts now use durable shared contradiction cases at world scope and retain richer
  typed provenance and verification rationale.
- Agent prompt versions are content-addressed and attributed to primitive use and terminal outcomes;
  the Ops dashboard and `productivity prompts` compare cohorts without retaining content.
- Readiness now qualifies live autonomy from multi-agent primitive use, communication, Marina tool
  calls, and latency. `/api/connect` advertises capability layers, trust boundaries, and tool-risk
  classes for model-agnostic opportunistic agents.
- Crew creation now issues durable, expiring invitations; agents explicitly join or decline rather
  than being conscripted by a creator.
- Tool calls carry risk class and privacy-safe trust-source lineage. The reference monitor blocks
  untrusted policy-bypass requests while Marina's existing gates remain authoritative.
- The persistence schema is now version 62; exports include contradiction cases, productivity
  sessions, crew invitations, prompt token/cost attribution, and primitive-use evidence. Evidence
  never retains command arguments or tool payloads.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Instance-wide login cap** — `MARINA_MAX_LOGINS` limits the total number of
  concurrently logged-in (entity-bound) connections on an instance
  (`0`/unset = unlimited). Enforced centrally in `engine.login()`/`reconnect()`
  so every surface — WebSocket, telnet, MCP — is covered, including the
  post-restart re-attach branch and grace-window reconnects.
- **Login-attempt rate limiting** — `MARINA_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_PER_MIN` throttles
  login/reconnect attempts per client IP (token bucket; default 10/min,
  `0` = disabled; falls back to per-connection keying when IP is unavailable,
  e.g. MCP sessions). Login was previously unthrottled despite being
  passwordless-by-name; failed attempts consume budget too.
- **Internal-agent exemption** — room/crew agents authenticate with the
  process-local internal token (new `internalToken` option on `MarinaClient`,
  passed automatically by the agent runtime). Internal connections are exempt
  from both limits and excluded from the cap denominator, so a low cap never
  breaks world population; agents remain bounded by `MAX_AGENTS`.

### Changed

- `Connection` gains optional `ip` and `internal` fields; the constant-time
  `secretsEqual` compare moved from the WebSocket server into shared
  `src/auth/secret-compare.ts`.

## [0.4.2] and earlier

Initial open-source release line: world engine with civic substrate (standing,
rank, safety gates), agent cognitive architecture, Chronicle, canvas intent
system, resolvers/watchers/calibration, orchestration patterns, benchmark
runner, TabH2O integration, drop-in compat surfaces (OpenAI, Ollama, ACP), and
the live-visualization dashboard. The `hermes`/`openclaw` migration worlds and
their third-party aliases were removed in 0.4.2.
